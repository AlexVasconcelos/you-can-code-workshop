# You Can Code

Today, we're going to be using HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages to build and publish our own websites dedicated to inspirational women and non-binary people.

### Step 1

Head [here](https://github.com/heatherlauren/you-can-code-workshop) and fork this repo to your own GitHub account (don't worry, we'll be going through everything together!)

### Step 2

Rename the forked repo to _username_.github.io, where _username_ is your username on GitHub (i.e. my repo would be called heatherlauren.github.io).

### Step 3

Clone the repo to your machine using GitHub Desktop.

### Step 4

Open the repo in Sublime Text.

### Step 5

Code away! Choose a woman or non-binary person that inspires you and hack my site

to tell the world about them.

### Step 6

Once you've made some changes, use GitHub Desktop to commit them and push them online.

### Step 7

Head to https://_username_.github.io, and admire your very own website!

### Step 8

Check out the __Where to Go Next__ section, and keep coding!
